# How to implement custom grouping


<p>This example shows how to group rows using custom rules. When grouping by the 'Unit Price' column, the rows in this column that have values between 0 and 10 should be combined into a single group. Rows whose values fall between 10 and 20 should be combined into another group, etc.</p>
